I want to build a project based on @requirements.md. I already have the boilerplate created from the `create-next-app` available in @src . As we want to create an app from scratch, don't worry about removing anything from the boilerplate code (e.g. @page.tsx contains boilerplate code for the main page of the example next-app).

Now, I want you to provide the codebase that will allow me to complete the Validation Checklist from the requirements.

I will score your answer based on these criteria:

- **Does it work?** If the app runs successfully and allows me to complete the whole user flow, thatâ€™s **1 point**.
- **Second chance fixes:** If it fails the first time but succeeds after my feedback, it still earns **0.5 points**.
- **Code vibes:** This is **1 point** if the code looks neat, organized, and easy to follow.
- **UI vibes:** Another **1 point** if the final user interface feels smooth and looks good.
